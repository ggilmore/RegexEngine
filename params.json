Create a new `RegexParser` instance and use its `parse()`\r\nmethod in order to create a [Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) instance that represents that\r\nregex. \r\n\r\nThe `MachineRunner` object has a method called `testInput` that takes a `Machine` and some `inputString` and returns a tuple of a boolean followed by a sequence of `ProgressionWithChar` instances. The boolean is `true` if `inputString` matches the regex described by the `Machine` and false otherwise. The sequences of `ProgressionWithChars` are a record of the sets of states that Machine was evaluating (still considered valid) as it consumed `inputString`. \r\n\r\nThe `Machine` companion object also has a helper function, called `toDOTFileFormat` that takes a `Machine`, and returns a string representation \r\nof that machine using the [DOT graph description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29).\r\nThis graph has nodes as states, unlabeled edges representing transitions that aren't contingent on any character, and labeled edges \r\nrepresenting transitions that are contingent on the character that the edge is labeled with. \r\n  \r\nExample of a graph generated from `toDOTFileFormat`'s output from the regex `((ab|b?)*w)`, after a single `b` was consumed. The valid states are highlighted in red: \r\n\r\n![example](http://i.imgur.com/EmgOj1i.png)\r\n\r\n#TODO:\r\n-test cases?\r\n\r\n-work on visualization of state machine \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
